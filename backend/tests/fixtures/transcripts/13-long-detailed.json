  "transcript": "Good afternoon, my name is David Anderson and I want to share my story with you. I'm 35 years old and I've been going through an incredibly difficult period in my life. About eight months ago, I was working as a software engineer at a tech company in Austin, Texas. I had a good salary, a nice apartment, and everything seemed to be going well. Then suddenly, the company went through massive layoffs and I lost my job along with hundreds of others. At first, I thought I'd find another position quickly given my experience and skills. I sent out over 200 job applications. I went to dozens of interviews. But the tech market has been really tough lately. Months passed and my savings started running out. I had to give up my apartment because I couldn't afford the rent anymore. I'm currently staying with a friend, but I can't impose on their hospitality much longer. I need help with several things. First, I desperately need to find employment - whether that's in my field or something different, I just need income. Second, I need housing assistance because I'll need my own place soon. Third, I need help with food because I'm trying to stretch every dollar. I also need some professional help with my resume and interview skills - maybe I'm doing something wrong. I feel embarrassed asking for help because I used to be successful and independent. But right now, I'm struggling and I need support. I'm hardworking, I have skills, and I know I can get back on track with the right assistance. Please contact me at david.anderson.dev@email.com or you can call me at 512-555-7788. I'm available anytime and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to rebuild my life and career. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen to my situation. I really appreciate any help or guidance you can provide.",

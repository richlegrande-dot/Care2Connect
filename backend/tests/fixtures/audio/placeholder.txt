# Placeholder audio files - replace with actual WAV files for full functionality

# To create real test audio files:
# 1. Record short (1-2 second) audio clips saying:
#    - English: "hello world test"  
#    - Spanish: "hola mundo prueba"
# 2. Convert to WAV format, mono, 16kHz sample rate
# 3. Save as en_short.wav and es_short.wav in this directory

# For now, the health checker will detect these as missing and report appropriately

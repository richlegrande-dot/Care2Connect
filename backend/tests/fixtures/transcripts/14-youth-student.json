  "transcript": "Hi, my name is Emma White. I'm 19 years old and I'm a college student at the University of Boston. I'm trying to pay for my tuition and living expenses on my own because my parents can't help me financially. I work part-time at a coffee shop, but it's not enough. I'm struggling to afford textbooks, rent for my dorm, and food. I've been skipping meals sometimes to save money. I really want to finish my degree in nursing so I can help people, but I'm worried I might have to drop out if I can't get some financial support. I need help with education costs, housing, and food. I'm in Boston, Massachusetts. My email is emma.white.student@college.edu. I'm working really hard and maintaining good grades. I just need a little help to make it through. Thank you for considering my request.",

## Overview

CareConnect generates a GoFundMe-ready draft with all the information you need. This guide shows you how to take that draft and create an actual campaign on GoFundMe.com.

**Important**: CareConnect does NOT post directly to GoFundMe. You must copy the drafted information into GoFundMe's website.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start:
- ✅ CareConnect draft completed (story, title, goal, category)
- ✅ GoFundMe account (or willingness to create one)
- ✅ Bank account for receiving funds (checking or savings)
- ✅ Optional: Photos or videos to add as cover media
- ✅ 15-30 minutes of uninterrupted time

## Step 1: Start Your Fundraiser

### What to Do:
1. Go to [GoFundMe.com](https://www.gofundme.com)
2. Click **"Start a GoFundMe"** (top right corner)
3. Choose your fundraising category from the list

### CareConnect Assistance:
- **Category** is already determined in your draft
- Look for: `Category: [Medical | Housing | Emergency | etc.]`

### Common Categories:
- Medical
- Emergency
- Memorial
- Education
- Family
- Community
- Business
- Other

### Tips:
- Choose the category that best matches your need
- The right category helps potential donors find your campaign
- You can change the category later if needed

---

## Step 2: Set Your Goal

### What to Do:
1. Enter your fundraising goal amount (in USD or your currency)
2. Click **"Continue"**

### CareConnect Assistance:
- **Goal Amount** is in your draft
- Look for: `Goal: $5,000` (example)
- Copy this amount exactly into GoFundMe

### Tips:
- Be realistic but don't underestimate your needs
- You can adjust your goal later if circumstances change
- Consider adding 10-15% buffer for transaction fees and unexpected costs
- Break down how funds will be used in your story

---

## Step 3: Create or Sign In to Your Account

### What to Do:
**If you have a GoFundMe account:**
1. Click **"Sign In"**
2. Enter your email and password

**If you're new to GoFundMe:**
1. Click **"Sign Up"**
2. Provide your:
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - Password
   - Phone number (for verification)
3. Verify your email address (check inbox for verification link)

### Tips:
- Use an email you check regularly - GoFundMe sends important updates here
- Choose a strong password and save it securely
- Phone verification helps prevent fraud and protects your campaign

---

## Step 4: Add Cover Media (Optional but Recommended)

### What to Do:
1. Click **"Add photo"** or **"Add video"**
2. Upload from your device:
   - **Photo**: JPG, PNG, or GIF (recommended size: 1200x630 pixels)
   - **Video**: MP4, MOV, or AVI (max 5 minutes, 1GB)
3. Add a caption (optional)

### CareConnect Assistance:
- CareConnect doesn't generate photos/videos
- Your draft may include **Cover Media Notes** with suggestions

### Tips:
- **Photos perform better** than campaigns without images
- Use a clear, well-lit photo that represents your story
- If raising funds for someone else, include their photo (with permission)
- Avoid copyrighted images or stock photos
- Personal, authentic images build trust

### No Photo? That's OK!
- You can skip this step and add media later
- GoFundMe provides a default placeholder image

---

## Step 5: Tell Your Story

### What to Do:
1. **Campaign Title**: Enter a short, compelling title (max 100 characters)
2. **Story**: Paste your full story in the text box
3. Format using the editor tools:
   - Bold, italics, bullet points
   - Add line breaks for readability
   - Include specific details and context

### CareConnect Assistance:
- **Title** is in your draft: `Title: Help John Get Back on His Feet` (example)
- **Story** is your full narrative - copy/paste directly from CareConnect

### What to Include in Your Story:
✅ **Introduction**: Who you are (or who you're raising funds for)  
✅ **Situation**: What happened and why you need help  
✅ **Goal**: How much you're raising and what it will cover  
✅ **Impact**: How donations will make a difference  
✅ **Gratitude**: Thank supporters and express appreciation

### Story Tips:
- **Be specific**: "I need $5,000 for first month's rent, deposit, and basic furniture" is better than "I need help with housing"
- **Be honest**: Authenticity builds trust
- **Use first-person**: "I'm" and "my" connect with readers
- **Proofread**: Check for typos and clarity
- **Update later**: You can edit your story anytime

### Character Limit:
- No strict limit, but **500-1000 words** is ideal
- Longer stories can work if they're engaging and well-organized

## Step 6: Add Location and Beneficiary Details

### What to Do:
1. **Location**: Select your city/country from the dropdown
2. **Beneficiary**: Choose who the fundraiser is for:
   - **Yourself**
   - **Someone else** (requires their name and email)
   - **Charity** (must be a registered 501(c)(3) in the US)

### CareConnect Assistance:
- **Location** is in your draft: `Location: Los Angeles, California` (example)
- **Beneficiary** is indicated: `Beneficiary: Self` or `Beneficiary: [Name]`

### Why Location Matters:
- Helps local community find your campaign
- Required for tax and compliance purposes
- Shows transparency to donors

### Beneficiary Options:
- **Yourself**: You receive the funds directly
- **Someone else**: They must accept the beneficiary role via email before funds are released
- **Charity**: Must provide the charity's EIN (tax ID number)

### Tips:
- If raising funds for someone else, make sure they agree and can access email
- Beneficiary can be changed later if needed

   - Title

   - Category
   - Story
   - Photos/videos
   - Location
   - Beneficiary
2. Read GoFundMe's Terms of Service

### Withdrawal Timeline:
- Funds are typically available **2-5 business days** after donation
- First withdrawal may take slightly longer due to verification
- You can withdraw as often as you like (no minimum)

### Tips:
- Use a bank account you actively monitor
- Make sure the account holder name matches your GoFundMe account
- If you don't have a bank account, consider opening one before publishing

## Step 9: Share Your Campaign

### What to Do:
1. Click **"Share"** on your campaign page

### Sharing Tips:

- **Tag relevant people/organizations**: Community groups, churches, nonprofits
- **Update regularly**: Post progress updates to keep momentum
- **Thank donors publicly**: Recognition encourages more giving
- **Share milestones**: "We're 50% to our goal!" builds excitement

### Example Share Message:
> "I've started a GoFundMe to help cover [reason]. Every donation, no matter the size, makes a difference. Please share if you can't donate - spreading the word is incredibly helpful. Link: [your URL]. Thank you for your support."

### Tips for Success:

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "I can't verify my identity"
**Solution**: Contact GoFundMe support. They may request:
- Government-issued ID (driver's license, passport)
- Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement)
- Additional documentation about your situation

### Issue: "My bank account won't connect"
**Solution**:
- Double-check account and routing numbers
- Try a different bank account
- Contact your bank to ensure there are no restrictions
- Reach out to GoFundMe support

### Issue: "My campaign isn't getting donations"
**Solution**:
- Share more frequently (daily on social media)
- Ask 5-10 people to donate first (builds social proof)
- Update your story with more specific details
- Add photos or videos if you haven't already
- Reach out to local media or community organizations

### Issue: "I need to pause my campaign"
**Solution**:
- You can't "pause," but you can stop sharing and let it go dormant
- Update your story to explain if circumstances change
- If you no longer need funds, consider donating excess to charity

### Issue: "Someone reported my campaign as fraudulent"
**Solution**:
- GoFundMe reviews all reports
- Provide documentation to prove legitimacy
- Respond promptly to GoFundMe's requests
- Be transparent in your story and updates

## GoFundMe Fees and Costs

### Platform Fee:
- **GoFundMe charges 0%** platform fee (as of 2024)
- You keep everything you raise

### Payment Processing:
- **2.9% + $0.30 per donation** (standard payment processing)
- Example: $100 donation = $96.80 to you
- Donors can choose to "tip" GoFundMe to cover costs (optional)

### Withdrawal:
- No withdrawal fees

### Tips for Donors:
- Explain that GoFundMe is free, but payment processing has small fees
- Suggest donors can cover these fees by adding a small tip

---

## Legal and Tax Considerations

### For Fundraiser Organizers:
- **You may owe taxes** on funds raised (consult a tax professional)
- In the US, GoFundMe doesn't issue 1099s for personal campaigns under $600, but you must still report income
- Keep receipts of how funds are used (especially for medical/business campaigns)

### For Donors:
- **Donations are generally NOT tax-deductible** (unless made to a verified charity via GoFundMe Charity)
- Personal fundraisers are considered gifts, not charitable contributions

### Compliance:
- Be honest in your story - fraudulent campaigns violate GoFundMe's Terms of Service
- You may be asked to provide documentation (medical bills, receipts, etc.)

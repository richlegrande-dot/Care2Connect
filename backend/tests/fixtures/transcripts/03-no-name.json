I'm currently staying in a shelter in Los Angeles. I need help finding permanent housing and getting back on my feet. I also need medical care because I have diabetes and can't afford my medication. You can reach me at 213-555-9876. I'm really hoping someone can help me. This situation has been so difficult and stressful.",
